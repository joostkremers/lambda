# Lambda #

If you're reading this, you're probably on the wrong page. Lambda is a simple Lisp based on the code in the book [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/). It lacks all kinds of features that a real programming language should have, so it's not really of use for anything interesting except for yours truly as a way to have some fun and learn something in the process. :-)
